**Hello there!**

My name is Anders Bo Justesen.

My research interests are exoplanetary systems and binary stars. I'm particularly interested in the formation and dynamical evolution of these systems. 

Since November 2016, I am a PhD student advised by Simon Albrecht at Aarhus University.

You can email me at <justesen@phys.au.dk>.
